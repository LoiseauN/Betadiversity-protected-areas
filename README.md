# Betadiversity-protected-areas

Code of the paper Loiseau et al. (2021) TITLE. Submitted to PlosBiology.

# Goal

    R code and data to reproduce figures of Loiseau et al. 2021 article.
    
## General

This repository is structured as follow:

- `Birds/`: Contains data and code to compute beta diversity for birds
- `Plants/`: Contains data and code to compute beta diversity for plants
- `Fish/`: Contains data and code to compute beta diversity for Fish
- `outputs/`: contains all data required to reproduce figures
- `R/`: contains all code required to reproduce figures



## Notes

- Figures will be stored in `figures/`
- Computation to compute beta diversity take time and require several cores
